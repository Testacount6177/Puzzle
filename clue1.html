        <h1>"The great wolf howled at the moon, yet only one stood against its might. Týr, bold and unwavering, placed his hand within Fenrir’s maw, knowing well his fate. The gods wove their plans in the hall of Asgard, choosing the day of battle, a day when warriors set forth, their blades gleaming under the morning sun. The halls of Valhalla sing of this day, calling upon those who seek the truth. Count not the days of men, but the time chosen by the gods, when the first steps to wisdom were made."</h1>

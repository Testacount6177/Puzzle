        <h1>"The ancients spoke not in words but in threads of fate. A single strand may tell of a village, but a series of knots reveal the truth of the universe. The chosen ones wove their records, binding time into fiber, their fingers dancing across the sacred cords. Upon the golden thread, two great knots hold the weight of the past, while seven smaller knots rest below, each one a step in the cycle of the sun. Only those who trace the weaverâ€™s hand will see the number that carries the light beyond the mountains, where the condor watches and the river sings its eternal song."</h1>
